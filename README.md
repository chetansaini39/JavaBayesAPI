## JavaBayesAPI
This is *not* the source code for the JavaBayes API but a compiled jar file for use within projects. 

If you want to look at the source code please refer to either:
[JavaBayes Original Codebase](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~javabayes/Home/) or [JavaBayes for Java 1.6](https://github.com/joeschweitzer/javabayes) and above (which is what this compiled jar is based on).

I've not altered their code in anyway but merely compiled and exported a jar file for others to use if need be.

Kind regards
